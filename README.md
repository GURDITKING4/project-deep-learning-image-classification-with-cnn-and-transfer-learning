Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
Load it as we did with the Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets in the lesson notebooks. Create visualizations of some sample images and their corresponding labels.
2. Preprocess your data
Apply normalization, reshaping, label encoding, and resizing as needed.
3. Design your CNN models
Start with a simple architecture, then experiment by increasing the number of layers, filters, and other parameters.
4. Train your models
Train at least two different CNN architectures. You can fine-tune hyperparameters such as the number of epochs (consider using early stopping), batch size, and learning rate.
5. Evaluate your models
 Report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualize the confusion matrix to analyze class-wise performance.
In this part, you should train and compare at least two different CNN models based on their performance
For the second part of the project, you will:
Perform transfer learning with your chosen pre-trained models (https://keras.io/api/applications/).
Train and evaluate at least two transfer learning models
Compare their performance with your custom CNN.
For the presentations:
Show your CNN architectures and a comparison between them, explaining which one performed best.
Then, compare the transfer learning models and evaluate their performance against your best CNN model.
Describe the preprocessing techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and any other relevant details you applied.
Discuss the advantages and trade-offs of using transfer learning versus building a model from scratch.
Each group will have 15 minutes for their presentation.
